            <p>In the world we live in today, it is a digital age where the Internet is inseparable from our daily lives. So when you get through your day on the Internet, whether it is scrolling through social media, buying from your favorite online store, or even watching the most popular TV show on a TV streaming service, do you wonder how these websites or companies know exactly what you are looking for? You got it right, it's data! </p>
            <p>Websites use data to understand who their customers are, and more importantly, <a href="http://www.cloudflare.com/learning/privacy/what-is-data-privacy">predict and target the types of content or products that are the most engaging for the user</a> in order for them to continue using their website. However, most people don't realize how much or what types of data could be collected, allowing the access to more data than users think. While the purpose of data collection from most of these platforms means no harm, sometimes there are people that can use these data with malicious intents. Without proper safeguards on platforms, it could lead to a data breach, which is the release of sensitive information. Personal information, such as health records, social security numbers, credit card information, and IP addresses, can be collected and taken advantage of, potentially putting you at risk of fraud, identity theft and other unethical activities. Vulnerable to a dangerous situation like this, how can you protect your own data? This is why data privacy is so important.</p>
            <p>Data privacy focuses on a person being able to control and properly handle the usage of their own personal data. It is crucial for individuals to have the ability to determine the extent of data that is being used and how they are used to prevent a breach of data. Furthermore, data privacy is important <a href="http://www.integrate.io/blog/what-is-data-privacy-why-is-it-important">as it establishes trust between organizations and their customers</a>. Organizations can be seen as reliable and trustworthy to their users when they prioritize data protection and show that they can be trusted with your data. This benefits both the companies and users as they get to create strong relationships with each other, with customers able to interact with a trustworthy organization and companies able to keep loyal customers.             </p>
            <p>Luckily, many countries have passed data protection laws. For example, the EU introduced the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) law, regulating how personal data would be processed and protecting the individual's right for privacy. In California, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) was passed, allowing consumers to control and be aware of the personal data that is used. Other countries like Australia, Canada, Singapore and Japan also have similar laws in data protection.             </p>
            <p>	However, even with these laws and regulations regarding data protection, some companies are not fully transparent with their data collection and usage terms, so always be careful on the Internet and stay safe!            </p>
