          <p>	Women have always been a part of tech, but how far does it go back and what did they contribute to the technology world? We'll figure it out right now.          </p>
          <p>One noticeable name is Ada Lovelace, the world's first computer programmer. She was born in 1815 and passed away in 1852. Ever since a young age, Ada Lovelace had a talent for mathematics and a great interest in engineering and mechanics. Lovelace took an interest in Charles Babbage's inventions and met him in 1833 due to their mutual friend, Mary Somerville. <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Charles-Babbage">Although Babbage only ended up building a small analytical engine. Lovelace had a working relationship with Charles Babbage, who created a complicated device that resembles a computer.</a> Although this invention was not released, Lovelace's involvement considers her and gives her the world's first computer programmer title. Alan Turing, the inventor of the first modern computer, took inspiration from Lovelace's notes in the 1940s. The early coding language, Ada, was named after her. Also, the second Tuesday in October has become a day to remember Ada Lovelace and her contributions to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.          </p>
          <p>Who doesn't use WiFi every day? For that, you can thank Hedy Lamarr—a popular film actress in the 1940s and a self-taught inventor. In 1942, Lamarr was awarded a patent for her genius invention, known previously as a "secret communication device." George Antheil was her co-designer, and together, they created a "frequency hopping system [that] was intended as a way to set radio-guided torpedos off course during the war." Although not directly inventing WiFi, her invention inspired the creation of WiFi, GPS, and Bluetooth.          </p>
          <p>Another notable name in the history of technology is Elizabeth Feinler, the woman who invented and ran the first search engine. Feinler ran the Network Information Center, now known as a "pre-historic Google." The Network Information Center ran in California and was the first website that published resources and directories online. Feinler's group also developed the domain naming scheme, which contains .com, .org, .edu, .gov, and .net.          </p>
          <p>Many women have shaped the way the technology world runs now, and there is no doubt that we can say that without them, the tech world would be entirely different. Although only a few women were mentioned in this blog, many other notable women have contributed tremendously to the tech world.          </p>
